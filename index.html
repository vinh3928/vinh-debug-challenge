                        <p class="story background_story"> Hello! My name is Vinh I'm 25 years old and I only recently moved to Lafayette, Colorado in August of 2014. I grew up in Naples, Florida a small town famous for its beaches and golf courses with a population of around 40,000 people.

    I grew up in a large family with three brothers and two sisters; me being the second youngest of my family. If I'm not working I am usally found enjoying the outdoors whether its a bike ride around town or a hike on a trail. One thing I miss from Florida is hanging out at the beach with friends. Theres a sense of peace and stillness where time slows down and the pace of life fades away when your on the beach relaxing.

    One thing I don't miss about Florida is the humidity. I am quite pleasantly suprised how mellow the winters are here in Colorado. This winter I went snowboarding for the first time and had a blast! I'm really looking forward to the spring; I hope to manage my time well so I can still be outside exploring new trails.

    Some foods I enjoy eating are of course Vietnamese food; but as of late I am experimenting with Indian cuisine. Recently I deided to give a vegan diet a try and have been experimenting with different foods I never would have tried otherwise. It's fun learning about new recipes and ingredients; for example I found that I really really enjoy figs. Yes, figs are amazingly good for someone who doesn't eat sweets often; they are just the right amount of sweet and healthy for me.

                        <p class="story interest_story"> In highschool I played alot of sports to past the time. I think that translate to today me enjoying playing organize sports. During highschool I played soccer, football, and polevaulted in track and field. My favorite sport is soccer because of how calming and relaxing the sport is when your in the moment. Right now I play 8 vs. 8 flag football in a Boulder league on Sundays.

    I haven't done a 14er yet; but this year I want to do at least one 14er. I enjoy camping trips and look forward to some camping trips this year; I hope that I can fit time in my schedule to be able to go on a weekend trip.

    When I'm not playing a sport or enjoying the outdoors I can also be found playing a videogame; Starcraft 2 being one of my favorite game. I enjoy fast pace console games like Halo where I can jump in and have fun the next moment.

    I listen to alot music off Spotify; right now I am in a acoustic mood. Come check out the afternoon acoustic channel!</p></li>

                        <p class="story workschool_story"> Ever since I was 14 years old; I always seem to have a job working and going to school at the same time. So writing this when I'm doing neither at the moment feels quite strange. I'v been a tanning salon clerk, pizza cook, delivery driver, mall kiosk seller, buser, server, researcher, laser application engineer, and a staff accountant. I've had quite diverse job experiences through my life.

    Out of highschool I went to a community college for two years while working full time. I transfered to the University of Florida (UF) in the chemical engineering program. During my time at UF I worked as a assistant researcher in a microbiology lab. There I learned alot about cellular pathways for mobility and started learning about programming in MatLab.

    After graduating from UF I took a job as a laser application engineer. Here I had alot of fun playing with lasers and experimenting with material interactions. After a year here, the job got predictable and at times boring; for me I have to be constantly engaged and learning new things so I accepted another job offer from my sister. Her company needed help with there finances so I spent a month learning on how to do bookkeeping and accounting before stepping in as a staff accountant.

    Being a staff accountant gave me a different perspective on how a business runs on a the financial side. After bringing her company's books up to speed I then searched for my next move. So here I am in gSchool doing something I enjoy: creating things.</p></li>
