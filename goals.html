                <h3>gSchool Goals</h3>
                    <p> It's pretty exiciting for me to be able to start learning more about programing and web development. I am most intersted in the back end development of how the flow of data ties into web development. For me it's interesting to analyse data to understand why things are the way they are.

    My goals are to put my best foot forward and try to learn as much as possible while in gSchool. This will give me the confidence to go out and start a career as a full stack develop with a focus on data analysis. I hope to meet amazing people on the journey to share the adventure of the unknown with. May it be over nights with coffee or beers. </p>
                <h3>Career Goals</h3>
                    <p> My career goals is to find a job that doesn't feel like working; but is fun and engaging. This is why I want to pursue web development because for me its fun to build something that people use. It's engaging because there is no perfect way to do something, theres many way to a solution and the challenge is in finding the best way at the time.

    The ideal job for me would be working with talented people in data visualization. My job description would be to create tools and web applications to explain the meaning of real world data.</p>
                <h3>Dreams</h3>
                    <p> I believe in social responsiblity and would like to work with a non-profit in the future as a volunteer position outside of work. Perhaps I can help build a interactive website or help their backend development.

    In 5 to 10 years I'm toying with the idea of going back to get my PhD in biomedical engineering. Perhaps contribute to the advancement of the scientific community. I don't know what my situation will be down the road; but one can always dream.</p>
